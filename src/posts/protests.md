## Organizing a protest

- [Join our discord](https://discord.gg/2XXWXvErfA) to discuss organizing a protest.
- Make sure you write a press release and send it to the media.
- Find coalition partners, and get as many people to join as possible.
- Pick a fitting location and date.
- Have something to hand out, like <a href="/PauseAI_flyer.pdf" target="_blank">our flyer</a>.
- Carefully consider the signs and how your pictures will look - they will lead a life of their own on social media.
