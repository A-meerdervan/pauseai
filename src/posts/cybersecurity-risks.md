title: Cybersecurity risks of AI
description: How AI could be used to hack all devices.
---

Virtually everything we do nowadays is in some way dependent on computers.
We pay for our groceries, plan our days, contact our loved ones and even drive our cars with computers.
This makes all of us vulnerable to cyberattacks.

Highly potent computer viruses (such as [Stuxnet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd1x0csO3hU)) have always been extremely hard to create, but AI could change that.
Instead of having to hire a team of highly skilled security experts/hackers to find zero-day exploits, you could just use a far cheaper AI to do it for you.

Modern AI systems can analyze and write software.
They [can find vulnerabilities](https://betterprogramming.pub/i-used-gpt-3-to-find-213-security-vulnerabilities-in-a-single-codebase-cc3870ba9411) in software, and [they could be used to exploit them](https://blog.checkpoint.com/2023/03/15/check-point-research-conducts-initial-security-analysis-of-chatgpt4-highlighting-potential-scenarios-for-accelerated-cybercrime/).
As AI capabilities grow, so will the vulnerabilities they can detect and the exploits they can create.

There will most likely come a point where an AI is better at hacking than the best human hackers.
This will make it possible to create computer viruses that are far more potent than anything we have seen before.
Such a virus might target vulnerabilities in various different operating systems and spread to effectively all machines that have some sort of connection to other computers (through WiFi, Bluetooth, UTP, etc.).

If creating these types of viruses becomes technically feasible, it is likely that someone will do it.
And when that happens, the effects could be devastating.
It could cause a global economic collapse, and it could even cause the collapse of our civilization.
If effectively all computers are disabled due to the virus, people will not be able to buy food, water, or other necessities.
