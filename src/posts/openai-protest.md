## Why at OpenAI?

OpenAI is currently building the most powerful AI models.
They are in the lead with the capacities of GPT-4.
Their decision to open up the GPT APIs to plugins has accelerated the development of AI drastically.
Still, we have a lot of respect for the work that OpenAI has done, and the people who work there.

We believe OpenAI is in the perfect position to take responsibility and support a pause on giant AI experiments.
