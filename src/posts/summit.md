title: AI Safety Summit
description: What it would take to organize a summit on AI safety.
---

The primary goal of PauseAI is to **convince one government to organize a summit where a treaty can be established to pause AI development**.
See the [proposal](/proposal) page for more information.
But what does such a summit look like?
Well, it will be a meeting of national governments, hosted by one of them.
A summit can take many days and will be attended by many people.
Organizing it is a monumental task, and we are not experts in this field.

The goal of the Summit itself is a _treaty_, which is a formal agreement between two or more states in reference to peace, alliance, commerce, or other international relations.
In our case, the AI Safety Treaty should be an agreement between the participating states to pause AI development until the risks are better understood.

## Organizing a summit

One government will have to take the lead in organizing the summit.
This government will be the host of the summit and will be responsible for the logistics.
They need to find a suitable date and location, arrange the catering, draft the agenda, and invite the other governments.

## Examples of Summits and resulting treaties

- **Montreal Protocol** (1987): The Montreal Protocol is an international environmental treaty designed to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances. It has been highly successful in reducing the use of substances like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and has contributed to the gradual recovery of the ozone layer.
- **Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants** (2001): The Stockholm Convention is an international treaty aimed at protecting human health and the environment from persistent organic pollutants (POPs). These are toxic chemicals that persist in the environment, bioaccumulate in living organisms, and can have serious adverse effects on human health and ecosystems. Scientists raised concerns about the harmful effects of POPs, including their ability to travel long distances through air and water currents. The convention led to the banning or severe restrictions on the production and use of several POPs, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), and dioxins.

## Potential speakers

We can assume that the summit will be attended by many people who will be relatively new to the topic of AI safety.
It is therefore important that the speakers are able to explain the concepts in a way that is easy to understand.
For this reason, we have compiled a list of potential speakers that we think would be a good fit for the summit.
The list is not exhaustive, and we welcome any suggestions for new speakers.

- Max Tegmark
- Robert Miles
- Connor Leahy
- Tristan Harris
- Stuart Russell
- Geoffrey Hinton

## Treaty

The treaty is the most important part of the summit.
It is the document that will be signed by the participating states and will be the basis for future negotiations.

- A temporary ban on the development of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4, until the risks are better understood.
- Periodic meetings to discuss the progress of AI safety research.
- Agreements on increasing national investments in AI safety research.
