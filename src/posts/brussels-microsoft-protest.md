## What do we want?

We want our governments (and the EU, specifically) to organize a [summit](/summit) about the risks of AI.
We want them to [pause AI development](/proposal) until we have a better understanding of [the risks](/risks).

## Why at Microsoft?

Microsoft and its subsidiary OpenAI are currently building the most powerful AI models.
They are in the lead with the capacities of GPT-4.
Their decision to open up their GPT APIs to plugins has accelerated the development of AI drastically.
We believe Microsoft is in a good position to take responsibility and support a pause on giant AI experiments.
