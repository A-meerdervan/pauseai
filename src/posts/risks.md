title: Risks of artificial intelligence
description: AI threatens our democracy, our technology, and our species.

AI is a powerful technology that is increasingly transforming our world.
It comes with amazing potential, but also with serious risks.

## Fake media

Much of our society is based on trust. We trust that the money in our bank account is real, that the news we read is true, and that the people who post reviews online exist.

AI systems are exceptionally good at creating fake media. They can create fake videos, fake audio, fake text, and fake images.
These capabilities are improving rapidly.
Just two years ago, we laughed at the horribly unrealistic dall-e images, but now we have [deepfake images winning photography contests](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/17/photographer-admits-prize-winning-image-was-ai-generated).

This could erode the trust we have in our society.
It could threaten the fundamentals of our democracy even more than social media did.

## Computer viruses and hacks

Virtually everything we do nowadays is in some way dependent on computers.
We pay for our groceries, plan our days, contact our loved ones and even drive our cars with computers.

Modern AI systems can analyze and write software.
They [can find vulnerabilities](https://betterprogramming.pub/i-used-gpt-3-to-find-213-security-vulnerabilities-in-a-single-codebase-cc3870ba9411) in software, and [they could be used to exploit them](https://blog.checkpoint.com/2023/03/15/check-point-research-conducts-initial-security-analysis-of-chatgpt4-highlighting-potential-scenarios-for-accelerated-cybercrime/).
As AI capabilities grow, so will the capabilities of the exploits they can create.

Highly potent computer viruses have always been extremely hard to create, but AI could change that.
Instead of having to hire a team of highly skilled security experts/hackers to find zero-day exploits, you could just use a far cheaper AI to do it for you.

## Existential Risk

Things that are very intelligent, are very powerful.
If we build a machine that is far more intelligent than humans, we need to be sure that it wants the same thing as we want.
However, this turns out to be very difficult.
This is called the _alignment problem_.
And if we fail to solve it in time, we are likely to end up with a machine that wants to convert all things on our planet into something else.
